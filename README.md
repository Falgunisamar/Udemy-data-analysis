-Subject that has maxmimum number of courses
-Top selling Courses
-Least Selling Courses
-Max.Number of Subscribers for Each Level of Course

**Methodology**
The analysis was conducted in a Jupyter Notebook using Python. Key steps included data loading and cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA) with statistical summaries and visualizations, data visualization using libraries like Matplotlib and Seaborn, and generating insights to answer the project's questions.

Results and key findings
**Insights**
Findings often reveal relationships between price and popularity, subject-wise trends, the impact of course difficulty (level) on pricing and lectures, and the correlation between content length (lectures and duration) and the number of subscribers.
