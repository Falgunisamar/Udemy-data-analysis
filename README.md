## 📜 Project Overview

This project is an **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** of a dataset containing information on Udemy courses. The primary goal is to uncover **trends, patterns, and insights** related to course prices, popularity, content, and duration.

The analysis seeks to answer key business questions such as:

* What are the different subjects for which Udemy offers courses?
* Which subject has the maximum number of courses?
* What are the top-selling courses?
* What are the least-selling courses?
* What is the maximum number of subscribers for each course level?
